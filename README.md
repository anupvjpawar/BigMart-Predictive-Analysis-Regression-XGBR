Sales Prediction with Machine Learning****

This project aims to predict sales for a retail dataset using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, cleaned, and analyzed to understand the distribution of key features. Various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, are trained and evaluated for their performance.

**Key Features:**

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: The dataset undergoes thorough cleaning, handling missing values, and creating new features such as 'item_category' and 'outlet_years'.
Data Visualization: Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib provide insights into categorical features like 'item_fat_content,' 'outlet_size,' 'outlet_location_type,' 'item_category,' and the distribution of numerical values.
Preprocessing: Label encoding and one-hot encoding are applied to prepare the data for training machine learning models.
Model Training: Several regression models are trained on the preprocessed data, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2 Score).
PDF Report Generation: A comprehensive PDF report is generated, summarizing the model evaluation results and predictions on the test dataset.

**
Dependencies:**

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
fpdf

**Usage:**

Load and preprocess the training and test datasets.
Train multiple regression models and evaluate their performance.
Generate a PDF report containing model evaluation results and predictions on the test dataset.
This project serves as a practical example of end-to-end machine learning, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result reporting.
